## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **BUG-0027**: Hybrid manual-phase persist for OpenCode direct slash commands — IsolationEvidence identity fields, `persistManualPhaseIsolation`, reject `tui-auto`, targeted glob widen, supported validator CLI, ten `test_bug0027_*` markers. npm publish deferred (`RELEASE_PUBLISH_MODE=confirm`). Sprint evidence: [`S0160`](handoffs/releases/S0160-release-notes.md).
- **BUG-0024**: Hybrid residual live-dispatch for OpenCode CLI TUI listed `/auto` — peer-branded Defined gate, stage-distinct `OPENCODE_*`, DISPATCH umbrella-only, eight `test_bug0024_*` markers. npm publish deferred (`RELEASE_PUBLISH_MODE=confirm`). Sprint evidence: [`S0159`](handoffs/releases/S0159-release-notes.md).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed
- **BUG-0026**: Ship an npm-safe standalone supported-kernel range fallback and required installer peers so `upgrade --host both` materializes `.its-magic/bin/itsm` instead of reporting a false `KERNEL_CONTRACT_MISMATCH` when the private root `standalone/` workspace is omitted.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed
- **BUG-0025**: Include `scripts/standalone_runtime_install_lib.py` in npm pack allowlist; fail-closed standalone bootstrap loader (`STANDALONE_BOOTSTRAP_FAILED`); kit `0.1.4` packaging twins; six `test_bug0025_*` markers. npm publish deferred (`RELEASE_PUBLISH_MODE=confirm`). Sprint evidence: [`S0157`](handoffs/releases/S0157-release-notes.md).
